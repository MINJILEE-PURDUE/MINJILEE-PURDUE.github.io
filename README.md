## <a id="About Me"></a>About Me

As my name suggests, I am originally from Seoul, South Korea, and I lived in Japan for a while. As a senior undergraduate student in 2016, I had the privilege of visiting Purdue University as part of a visiting scholar group. The experience left a lasting impression, and I was thrilled to return to Purdue after receiving an offer, largely due to the outstanding teamwork.

My master's thesis focused on designing a zipper robot integrated with a machine learning algorithm to determine the optimal threshold using sensor data collected from people with physical disabilities. The algorithm leveraged the data to enhance the robot's performance and adaptability, providing a more efficient and user-friendly experience for individuals with varying levels of physical ability.

## Selected Projects

### Semantic Segmentation
In addition to my work in integrating AI and ML in agriculture and forestry, I have a keen interest in the analysis of geographical and meteorological data. This field offers rich opportunities for leveraging machine learning techniques to gain insights into various environmental phenomena and make informed decisions.

#### Research Focus

My research in this area centers around leveraging advanced machine learning models and techniques to analyze large-scale geographical and meteorological datasets. By applying data analysis methods to understand patterns, trends, and anomalies in weather and environmental data, I aim to contribute to our understanding of complex Earth systems and support decision-making processes in areas such as climate adaptation, disaster preparedness, and resource management.

### Current Projects

- **Geospatial Analysis of Climate Data:** I am currently involved in a project that focuses on analyzing climate data collected from various geographical locations. By applying machine learning algorithms to this data, we aim to identify patterns and trends in temperature, precipitation, and other meteorological variables over time.

- **Predictive Modeling for Extreme Weather Events:** Another project I am working on involves developing predictive models for extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, floods, and droughts. By combining historical weather data with machine learning techniques, we aim to improve the accuracy of forecasting and enhance preparedness and response efforts.

### Tools and Techniques

In my work, I utilize a range of tools and techniques for analyzing geographical and meteorological data, including:

- Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software for spatial analysis and visualization
- Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization
- Machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and scikit-learn for building predictive models
- Statistical methods for analyzing climate data and identifying trends and patterns

### Future Directions

Looking ahead, I'm enthusiastic about delving into the realm of data analysis. During my internship experiences, I adeptly managed geographical and meteorological data analysis projects, engaging in interdisciplinary collaborations and leveraging novel data sources and innovative machine learning techniques. In industry, I was engaged with LG Innotek, where I utilized data-driven insights to tackle urgent environmental issues and contribute to the progression of scientific understanding in this domain.
