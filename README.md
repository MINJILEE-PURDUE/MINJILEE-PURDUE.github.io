Hi there. I’m a Ph.D. Candidate in Technology at Purdue University. I love computer vision, especially semantic segmentation.

I’m currently working on DiT Model development as a Research Assistant at Purdue University M2M Lab under Dr. Matson's advisor.

Feel free to reach out to me at lee3450@purdue.edu if you have any questions.
